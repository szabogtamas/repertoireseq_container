## Setup

### Initialize tools

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Import packages

library(tidyr)
```

### Define seed sequences

A set of BCR sequences after vaccination published by [Poulsen et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21930965/) were downloaded from [PIRD](https://db.cngb.org/pird/tbadb/).


```{r}
seed_igh_sequences = c()
seed_igk_sequences = c()
seed_igl_sequences = c()
```
